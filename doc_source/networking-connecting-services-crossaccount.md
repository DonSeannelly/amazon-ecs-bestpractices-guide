# Networking services across AWS accounts and VPCs<a name="networking-connecting-services-crossaccount"></a>

If you're part of an organization with multiple teams and divisions, you probably deploy services independently into separate VPCs inside a shared AWS account or into VPCs that are associated with mutliple individual AWS accounts\. No matter which way you deploy your services, we recommend that you supplement your networking components to help route traffic between VPCs\. For this, several AWS services can be used to supplement your existing networking components\.
+ AWS Transit Gateway — You should consider this networking service first\. This service serves as a central hub for routing your connections between Amazon VPCs, AWS accounts, and on\-premises networks\. For more information, see [What is a transit gateway?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.html) in the *Amazon VPC Transit Gateways Guide*\.
+ Amazon VPC and VPN support — You can use this service to create site\-to\-site VPN connections for connecting on\-premises networks to your VPC\. For more information, see [What is AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) in the *AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN User Guide*\.
+ Amazon VPC — You can use Amazon VPC peering to help you to connect multiple VPCs, either in the same account, or across accounts\. For more information, see [What is VPC peering?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html) in the *Amazon VPC Peering Guide*\.
+ Shared VPCs — You can use a VPC and VPC subnets across multiple AWS accounts\. For more information, see [Working with shared VPCs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.
