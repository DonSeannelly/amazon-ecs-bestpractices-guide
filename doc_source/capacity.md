Amazon ECS is used to run containerized application workloads of all sizes, from minimal testing environments to large production environments operating at global scale\.

With Amazon ECS, like all AWS services, you pay only for what you use\. When architected appropriately, you can save cost by having your application consume only the resources it needs at the time it needs them\. This best practices guide is designed to help you run your Amazon ECS workloads in a way that meets your service\-level objectives while operating in a cost\-effective manner\.
